Expressing Data

Mon/Wed 4:00pm - 5:30pm 

Course Description

Human beings are producing, consuming and sharing data at any given moment. However, what kinds of data are meaningful to us? How do we capture and collect that data? What are the best ways to present it? What stories do we want to tell with data? This course will explore these questions and more. Students will learn basic techniques for data collection and filtering. Student projects can be digital, physical, visual, musical, or (with approval) take any form imagined.
Prerequisite: Interaction Lab


Learning Objectives

 * Students will understand data compositions behind objects.
 * Students will learn basic technologies of capturing and visualizing data.
 * Students will explore online data through APIs.


Assignments

There are 4 assignments and 1 final project in this course. In the first 4 weeks, students will capture one data series per week, sketch out the data in paper as Monday assignment; learn some related computer technology, and sketch out the same data in code as Wednesday assignment.
 * Week 1: Capture data about stuff you eat or drink in text
 * Week 2: Take photos about people or things you see
